Battleship

As of right now the game supports multiple randomized ships that the
player is asked to guess. I would like to keep slowly adding content
until the player is able to place their own ships for the cpu to find.

The two player version will be a little more difficult for this game
because I will have to find a way for players to place their ships,
maybe I could do this visually and have the ships flash on the board
until the player has placed them?

Ships of differing size also present a problem. I'll have to look into
altering the code to use a 'ship' class for this.
