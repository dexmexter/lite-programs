This one still needs lots of work. Eventually it should play like yatzee.
I still need to have the dice rolls be randomized. Letting the player
reroll certain dice could happen and then once they have the dice are
picked, the player could pick an empty category. The game would be
finished in a set number of rounds, one for each category.

One way to have the cpu work is to have a difficulty setting and just pick
a random integer between certain thresholds. Having the computer smartly
choose which dice to reroll so that they can pick a good category seems
difficult to implement.

The two player version of this game would be easier to make as all the
dice rerolls and categories would be picked by a human.

Displaying the scorcard would be nice. The player could make selections
(dice and category) with arrow keys and enter? That way the list of
categories can get smaller each time.
